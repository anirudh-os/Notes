# The "Hello, world!" Program

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Here **main()** is the main function (obviously) and **println** is the macro with which the output can be displayed on the output console..

1. The indentation in rust is 4 spaces and not a tab.
2. **println** is a macro and thats why we use the '!' (more on that later).
3. Every statement in rust must end with a semi-colon(;).
