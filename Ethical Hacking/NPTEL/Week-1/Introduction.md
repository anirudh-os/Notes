# Intro to Ethical Hacking

## Terminologies

1. Cracking: Breaching the software security systems
2. Spoofing: Falsifying the ip address
3. Datagram: a packet that flows in a network
4. Denial of service: Flooding a server with enormous network traffic so that it ceases to respond to legitimate requests
5. Ping (Packet Inter-Network Groper): This helps the user to test and verify the existence of the ip they are trying to access and whether it can accept requests or not
6. Ports: Entry or exit points of a system
7. Exploits: Vulnerabilities of a system through which we can gain access to it

## Gaining Access

### Front Door

1. Password Guessing
2. Password / key stealing

### Backdoor

It is a port often left by the hardware/software developers for debugging and diagnostic purposes

### Trojan Horses

* It is a malware hidden inside another software
* These can install backdoors, steal info or mine crypto

### Sofware Vulnerabilities

* Sometimes the software manufacturer's have a website where the vulnerabilities of their product are posted to request patches or fixes
* Newbie hackers (also called `script kiddies`) use these for practice
